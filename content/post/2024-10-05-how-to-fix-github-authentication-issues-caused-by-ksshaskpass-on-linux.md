### **How to Fix GitHub Authentication Issues Caused by Ksshaskpass on Linux**

If you’ve ever run into an issue where your GitHub password is mistakenly stored as your username in the `ksshaskpass` utility, you’re not alone! This problem has affected many users on Linux distributions like Fedora and Kubuntu, where `ksshaskpass` manages credentials for Git operations. The confusion arises from an unintuitive prompt that can lead you to accidentally input your GitHub password when it asks for your username.

In this post, we'll discuss the problem, how to fix it, and why this issue still lingers in modern Linux systems.

### The Problem

`ksshaskpass` is used in KDE-based environments to manage credentials for Git, among other tools. However, the first time users try to push to GitHub, `ksshaskpass` may ask for a "username" using a password field with masked input (showing `*` characters). This confusing prompt has led users to accidentally input their **password** instead of their **username**.

When this happens, GitHub then mistakenly stores your password as the username, leading to authentication issues. From that point on, you’ll see a misleading error when you try to push code, such as:

```
Password for 'https://<password>@github.com':
```

The result is that GitHub now believes your password is the username, and you’re locked into this faulty configuration. Unfortunately, clearing credentials via Git or the terminal won’t immediately fix the problem.

### The Solution

Here’s how you can resolve this issue if you’ve accidentally entered your password where your username should be in `ksshaskpass`. You’ll need to edit the stored credentials in **KWallet**, the password manager used by KDE-based systems.

#### Steps to Fix the Credentials in KWallet:

1. **Open KWalletManager**:
   If you don’t already have `KWalletManager` installed, you can install it by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install kwalletmanager
   ```

2. **Launch KWalletManager**:
   Open the program by typing `kwalletmanager5` in your terminal or searching for it in your system’s applications menu.

3. **Find the `ksshaskpass` Folder**:
   Once inside `KWalletManager`, navigate to the folder labeled `ksshaskpass`. This is where the tool stores credentials for GitHub and other services.

4. **Edit the Username and Password**:
   - **Username Issue**: Look for a password entry associated with `https://github.com`. Inside, you’ll likely find your **password** stored where your **username** should be. Edit this field and replace your password with your actual GitHub username.
   - **Password Issue**: There might be another entry named something like `https://username@yourdomain.com@github.com`. This will likely contain your actual GitHub password. Delete this entry to remove the stored password.

5. **Save Changes**:
   After making these edits, save your changes and close `KWalletManager`.

6. **Test the Fix**:
   Now, try pushing or pulling from GitHub again. If all went well, `ksshaskpass` should prompt you for the correct username and password (or a personal access token if you are using one), and your authentication issue should be resolved.

### Why This Issue Still Exists

This bug was first reported back in **2013** on **Fedora 29** but still persists today in various Linux distributions. Despite being a long-standing issue, it remains unresolved in the latest versions of Fedora, Kubuntu, and other KDE-based Linux systems as of 2019.

The root cause lies in how `ksshaskpass` interacts with `KWallet`, especially during the first Git operation where it asks for credentials. The input fields don’t clearly distinguish between a username and password, causing users to inadvertently enter incorrect information.

While the fix is relatively simple (as outlined above), the confusing prompt and the lack of a proper GUI to easily update credentials have kept this problem alive for many Linux users.

### Final Thoughts

If you're running into problems with `ksshaskpass` storing the wrong GitHub credentials, don't worry! By using `KWalletManager`, you can easily access and edit the saved information. However, this bug highlights a long-standing issue with Linux's password management tools that developers still need to address.

In the meantime, if you're looking for a more reliable solution, consider switching to **SSH** for GitHub authentication or using a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** for HTTPS operations. Both methods bypass `ksshaskpass` entirely and can make your GitHub workflow more secure and hassle-free.
