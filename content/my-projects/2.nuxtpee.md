### Responsibility

As a frontend developer here I was responsible for creating front-end codes for websites, my main role is to design visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. This involves translating design concepts into web pages that look great on various devices and browsers. I also focus on delivering a smooth user experience, optimizing page load times, and ensuring that the website is compatible with different browsers. 

Collaboration with designers and back-end developers is a crucial part of my job to make sure the user interface and functionality work seamlessly together. Staying updated with the latest web development trends and best practices is also essential to deliver high-quality websites for our clients.
