### Overview

**Sunflower Land Farm Helper: Mass Plant & Harvest** is a Chrome extension that I developed to enhance the player experience in the popular web game **Sunflower Land**. The extension allows players to plant and harvest crops in bulk with a single click, streamlining the repetitive tasks of the game while maintaining control over gameplay. It demonstrates my ability to integrate efficient, user-friendly functionality within a web environment.

### Key Features

* **Bulk Planting & Harvesting:** Perform mass planting and harvesting operations with just a click, significantly reducing manual effort for players.
* **Intuitive Interface:** Simple, user-friendly buttons are integrated directly into the game screen for easy access and optimal user experience.
* **Performance Optimization:** The extension is designed to run efficiently within the game, without affecting overall performance.

### Technologies Used

* **JavaScript**: To manage DOM manipulation and inject functionality directly into the game environment.
* **Chrome Extensions API**: To provide an interface for the extension to interact with browser tabs and game content.
* **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the interface elements, such as the buttons for planting and harvesting.

### Development Approach

In building this extension, I focused on making the user experience as smooth as possible by creating an interface that integrates seamlessly into the existing game. Leveraging the Chrome Extensions API, I injected content scripts to handle mass DOM manipulations, enabling quick planting and harvesting in the game. 

The permissions used are minimal to ensure user privacy, and the extension operates solely on the **Sunflower Land** game environment, avoiding any unnecessary access to user data.

### Challenges

* **DOM Element Handling:** The game dynamically loads elements, so I needed to ensure my JavaScript logic correctly identified and interacted with them in real-time.
* **User Interface Design:** Creating a UI that integrates into the game's interface without disrupting the design required careful positioning and consideration of z-indexes.

### Try It Out

You can [install the extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sunflower-land-farm-helpe/innimeplbaacgjbdpohblfgamoheoihi)  from the Chrome Web Store and use it while playing **Sunflower Land** to simplify your farming tasks.
