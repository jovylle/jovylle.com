**Project Overview:**

I had the pleasure of designing and developing a wedding website for my friends, Vyns and Tiney, to celebrate their special day. The site serves as a digital invitation and resource hub for guests, blending aesthetics with functionality.

**Live Site:** [vynsandtiney.atcebu.win](https://vynsandtiney.atcebu.win/)

**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML**: Crafted a clean and structured layout to enhance user experience.
* **CSS**: Utilized modern styling techniques to create a visually appealing design that reflects the couple's personality.

**Key Features:**

* **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
* **Event Details**: Included sections for wedding date, venue, and schedule to keep guests informed.
* **RSVP Functionality**: Developed an RSVP section to allow guests to confirm their attendance effortlessly.
* **Gallery**: Showcased a gallery of the couple's journey, adding a personal touch.

**Outcome:**

The website not only met Vyns and Tiney's vision but also received positive feedback from guests for its ease of use and attractive design. This project enhanced my skills in front-end development and reinforced my passion for creating meaningful digital experiences.
